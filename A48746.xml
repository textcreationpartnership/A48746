         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THIS Paper was written laſt Winter: and ſhould then have been publiſhed, had it not been for ſome Impediments. And the Buſineſs of <hi>Valona</hi> happening ſince, the mention of it is now added in the tranſcribing. I crave leave to ſay further, that the whole Form of this Project was communicated divers Months agoe, to ſome Perſons proper. and if they were not pleaſed to make uſe or take notice of it, the Author is not to be blamed. The time ſeems not yet paſt, for purſuing the Deſign here recommended. But if it ſhould be paſt, ſo that it were now too late to ſhew what may be done; yet it will be a Satisfaction to the curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, to know what might have been. Moreover there are ſome things here offer'd, that may
<pb facs="tcp:104459:3"/>perhaps rouze up the Spirits of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, and put them likewiſe in Mind to do ſome Good for themſelves. Of which there is now ſuch an Opportunity, as is hardly to be again expected. But if it be decreed that We muſt get nothing, we muſt be content.</p>

            <head>A PROJECT OF A DESCENT INTO <hi>FRANCE.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>I That erewhile have ſounded a Trumpet for a Voyage Royal into <hi>France,</hi> muſt now aim at lower and leſſer things, and content my ſelf with a Deſcent: if even that may be obtain'd. Had we a Peace in <hi>Ireland,</hi> we might continue our Thoughts of a Voyage Royal. Our King might then be in the Head of a mighty Army, compoſed entirely of his own Subjects: who would delight to follow him and ſerve him in ſo glorious an Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. He might have them to any number under a hundred Thouſand. We might then act ſeparately, and with Honour; and we might make a great Figure in the World. And moreover we might hereby
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:104459:4"/>give to our Confederates a moſt effectual Aſſiſtance; making their Work eaſie by ſo ſtrong a Diverſion. Such an Invaſion as this, would in all Probability turn the Fortune of the Warr at once: Such a Voyage as this, would make us emulate the great Actions of our Anceſtors in <hi>France:</hi> and we might reaſonably hope for as good Succeſs. For tho the <hi>French</hi> are much ſtronger now, than they were in thoſe days; yet by reaſon of their many other Enemies, aſſailing them on all ſides, we ſhould find them much weaker.</p>
            <p>Theſe would be the Effects of a Peace in <hi>Ireland.</hi> But this Peace hath not been had: there have been too little Inclinations to it. Though all <hi>Europe</hi> (I mean, all thoſe that would pull down the <hi>French</hi> King) be as much concern'd to have it, as to have a Peace in <hi>Hungary.</hi> For there is the ſame Conſequence and Advantage of both: and that is, That thereby we may be enabled to bring all our Forces againſt the <hi>French.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This being the Condition of Affairs, and the main of our Force being ſtill detained in <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſo that only Part of it can act againſt <hi>France;</hi> it is to be conſider'd, how this Part may be employed to moſt Advantage. Suppoſe then that of our ſeventy Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Men (which is the preſent Eſtabliſhment want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a few Hundreds, and for which the Parliament hath provided full Pay) we ſhould turn twenty Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand againſt <hi>France.</hi> And I hope we may ſuppoſe likewiſe, that we ſhall have a Fleet out this Summer,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:104459:4"/>that will make us Maſters at Sea. Here I preſume to affirm, that this twenty Thouſand Men being put on board our Fleet, will do more Service, and be a greater Terror to the <hi>French,</hi> than any other way whatſoever.</p>
            <p>But what muſt theſe Men do when they are on board the Fleet? What will be their Buſineſs? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; their Buſineſs will be, to run ſtraight upon the <hi>French</hi> Coaſt, and there to Land: or in other Words, to make a vigorous Deſcent into <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are ſeveral things that recommend this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to us.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The <hi>French</hi> cannot hinder us from Landing. tho they had no other Enemy, and though all their Forces were drawn down to the Sea-ſide, yet it could not be done. But when all their regular Troops are engaged elſewhere, it were a great Miſtake, if <hi>Arrier Bans</hi> and Country Militias ſhould ſo much as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour it. Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi> knew theſe Matters as well as any Man in the World. And his bare Opinion might ſeem ſufficient in the Caſe. But he not only affirms, but alſo gives plain and clear De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration, that it is impoſſible to keep an Enemy from Landing, if he be Maſter at Sea. And the thing is confirmed by univerſal Experience. For never a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Army that came againſt a Country by Sea, did fail to Land upon it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, When we are Landed, nothing can hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us from fortifying. If twenty Thouſand Men, having the Sea and a Fleet behind them, cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:104459:5"/>(either in a Town or upon the open Shoar) ſo as to defend themſelves againſt any Force that can be brought againſt them; they deſerve to be cut in pieces. But they muſt labour hard: and they muſt have good ſtore of Spades, and Mattocks, and Baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, and Barrows: and they ſhould carry Paliſadoes ready with them.</p>
            <p>In the third Place, Nothing can hinder, but that the Place we thus fortifie may be ſome weak Port. There are many ſuch on that ſide of <hi>France</hi> which lyes upon our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Channel: and which is, from <hi>Calice</hi> to <hi>Breſt,</hi> near five hundred Miles in Length. But in all this Coaſt between <hi>Breſt</hi> and <hi>Calice,</hi> there are but three Ports of any Strength conſiderable; and thoſe are <hi>Havre de Grace, Honfleur</hi> and S. <hi>Maloes.</hi> All the reſt are in a manner open Towns, and may be eaſily ſeized by any ſtrong hand that approaches them. As for <hi>Graveling</hi> and <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> they are in the <hi>French Flanders,</hi> and out of theſe Bounds.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Any Port that we thus fortifie, may be made as good as <hi>Calice:</hi> provided it be relievable by Sea, and not commanded by Land. And by the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of twenty Thouſand Men, it may in two Months time be put in ſuch a Condition; that a Garriſon of eight or ten Thouſand, being backed by the whole Power of <hi>England,</hi> will defend it againſt the whole Power of <hi>France.</hi> It is not neceſſary, that it ſhould be a good Port: it cannot well be worſe than <hi>Calice.</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> have no good Port upon theſe narrow
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:104459:5"/>Seas, ſave only <hi>Breſt,</hi> and S. <hi>Malo</hi>'s, and <hi>Dunkirk.</hi> It will be ſufficient, if the Place can receive and ſecure ſmall Veſſels. Alſo this Place ſhould be upon theſe Seas, that it may be reinforced and ſupplied from <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> with every Snatch of Wind: lying alſo in the way of our grand Fleet.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, This rampant Garriſon, having a thouſand or fifteen hundred Horſe lodged in it, will command the Country far and wide. The <hi>French</hi> in <hi>Maſtricht,</hi> with the like number of Horſe, exacted ſo great a Contribution, that they ſent at one time (over and above the maintenance of the Garriſon) eight hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Thouſand Crowns in Mony to their <hi>Flanders</hi> Army. <hi>Dunkirk</hi> had but five hundred Horſe while the <hi>Engliſh</hi> held it: and they commanded Contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion forty Miles round. as I have been told by Sir <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bias Bridges,</hi> who had the Command of thoſe Horſe.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, I grant that the <hi>French</hi> will do their utmoſt to curbe and bridle this Garriſon. But it will be to lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle purpoſe. While the <hi>Dutch</hi> held <hi>Oſtend,</hi> all the Power of <hi>Spain</hi> (which was then very great) could not hinder that Garriſon from making Incurſions into <hi>Flanders.</hi> But if the <hi>French</hi> ſhould beſet us with extraordinary Vigour, we muſt take them off by giving them more Work elſewhere. that is, by ſeizing and fortifying ſome other Ports. For my meaning is, that our moving Force be ſtill kept up to the full number of twenty Thouſand; to make farther Progreſſes, and to harraſs and torment the <hi>French.</hi> When theſe Fires are thus kindled in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:104459:6"/>Places, they will find it very hard to quench them. and tho poſſibly they might be able to oppoſe the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults of one Garriſon, yet they can never bear up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt three or four, or perhaps a greater number. Theſe Garriſons being ſcattered upon their whole Coaſt of five hundred Miles; and every one of them having behind it the whole Power of <hi>England,</hi> to ſupport and enforce it. Admitting therefore, that the Power of <hi>France</hi> were double or treble to that of <hi>England,</hi> and that their whole Power were turned againſt us; yet having them at this Lock, we ſhould be too hard for them.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, There needs no mighty number of Tranſport Ships for this Service. For our Grand Fleet, which will be always in theſe Seas, will with great eaſe carry over the fore-mention'd twenty thouſand Men. I mean the Foot; of which this Force will almoſt wholly conſiſt. For the Horſe muſt be carried in Veſſels proper, which may alſo be done at leiſure; they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not uſeful either in the Landing or the Fortifying, which are the Things firſt to be done. It is not here intended, that our great Ships of War ſhould run cloſe in to the <hi>French</hi> Shore: for generally the Seas are there ſhallow and dangerous. But they may go as near as they can ſafely; and there lying off, they may ſend the Men aſhore in their Boats and Tenders, or in other ſmall Veſſels. which for a Miles Paſſage, or two or three Miles, may be ſtuffed as full as they can hold.</p>
            <pb n="7" facs="tcp:104459:6"/>
            <p>Eighthly, If we can fix Garriſons in this <hi>French</hi> Coaſt, we may well preſume they will be ſtrongly ſupported from <hi>England.</hi> The greateſt part of our ſtanding Forces may without much inconvenience lie in the Counties adjoyning to that Sea, and be ready to embark upon all Occaſions. And I may venture to ſay, That even our Trained Bands (and particularly thoſe of the ſaid adjoyning Counties) would march with all chearfulneſs, to make good our Footing in <hi>France.</hi> the <hi>London</hi> Auxiliaries I dare engage will do it. Nor can Ships be wanting to tranſport them. for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the Ships that muſt be kept for that purpoſe, thoſe Seas are always full both of our Men of War and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants. But ſince ſtanding Armies muſt not always be in <hi>England;</hi> and ſince the Militia's of ſome Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties muſt not be preſs'd with greater Duty than others, unleſs in caſes extraordinary; we muſt think of ſome way beſide, to ſupport and enforce our <hi>French</hi> Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. It is therefore propoſed, that fifteen or twenty thouſand Foot, and three or four thouſand Horſe be liſted and armed in the ſaid adjoyning Counties; that is, in the Counties to the South of <hi>Thames,</hi> with the addition of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Middleſex.</hi> Theſe Troops to be ready to march and embark upon every ſudden Command. Every Footman to have forty or fifty Shillings a Year, and a Horſeman eight or ten Pound, and their Officers in proportion: with full Pay while they are in Service. Such an Eſtabliſhment will not be of any great Charge. but what ever it be, <hi>France</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:104459:7"/>will be made to pay it. For our Garriſons in <hi>France,</hi> being back'd by ſuch a Body of Horſe and Foot, will command much farther into the Country: each of them will command as far, as if this Body of Men were conſtantly lodged in it. And ſurely <hi>England</hi> will then be glorious, when we have a Range of Garriſons the whole length of the Channel, upon <hi>French</hi> Ground, and maintain'd by <hi>French</hi> Contributions. It will be ſuch a Frontier, ſuch a Barrier, as never any Kingdom hath had the like.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, There are upon this <hi>French</hi> Coaſt, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath been noted, divers Ports and Creeks (ſuch as they are) that are capable of being well fortified. but ſome of them are more inviting than the reſt: of which I ſhall name a few. In <hi>Picardy</hi> there is <hi>Bologne,</hi> or (as we call it) <hi>Bullen:</hi> a place of great Fame amongſt us <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men, ſince <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth took it. But all its Fortifications are now demoliſht, ſave only the old Walls of the upper Town. I confeſs this Place is not for our turn: becauſe even the lower Town lies ſome diſtance from the Sea. But we may remember, that while we held it, the <hi>French</hi> begun a Fort (and they called it <hi>Fort Chaſtillon,</hi> from the Famous Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of that Name) between the Sea and the lower Town. If we ſhould now make a large Intrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this Place, (for little ones are good for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,) and ſhould fill it with a Garriſon of ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Men, it would diſmember all the <hi>French</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts in <hi>Flanders:</hi> for it would command them quite
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:104459:7"/>thorough. It would do the <hi>French</hi> five times more hurt, than the taking of <hi>Mons</hi> hath done them good. In vain would <hi>Humieres</hi> guard his Line, to hinder the Incurſions of the <hi>Brabanders,</hi> if ſuch a Fire were kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled behind him. Then if we go on to <hi>Normandy,</hi> we ſhall there find <hi>Harflew</hi> and <hi>Quillebeuf</hi> at the Mouth of the <hi>Seine.</hi> which Places, though they lie open at preſent, have been ſtrong formerly. The former en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured a Siege from our <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth when he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd <hi>Normandy:</hi> being the Firſt-fruits of that glorious Expedition. And the later, in the Civil Wars of <hi>France,</hi> was the only place for a time, that <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth had upon that River. during which time, it ſhrewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly annoyed <hi>Roan</hi> and the other Places which the Leaguers held. If it be objected that <hi>Havre de Grace</hi> and <hi>Honfleur</hi> lie lower upon the ſame River, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſtop the Paſſage to the other two Places; I deny the Conſequence: for the River is here ſo wide, that there is no ſtopping of the Paſſage. Moreover in the ſame <hi>Normandy</hi> there is the Town of <hi>Cherburg,</hi> juſt over-againſt our <hi>Spit-head.</hi> It was always a Garriſon till this dangerous War broke out. At which time the <hi>French</hi> King reſolved to keep no Garriſons, ſave very ſtrong ones. And he found that this Place could not be made very ſtrong, unleſs ſome high Grounds were taken in that command it. which new Line would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire ſo much Labour to make it, and ſo many Men to defend it, that he choſe rather to ſlight the whole, an old Caſtle excepted; which Caſtle is of no Strength to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:104459:8"/>the Land, againſt an Enemy that hath made a Deſcent. If we go further on to <hi>Bretagne,</hi> the Haven of <hi>Conqueſt</hi> doth there lie fair for us. I confeſs it is no deep Harbour, it lying dry at every low Water: But a great and ſtrong Fortification in this place, with a great and ſtrong Garriſon in it, would be very uſeful to us, were the Harbour never ſo mean. Alſo this Place is ſo much the better, becauſe it is ſo near the Port of <hi>Breſt,</hi> and would be a means to bring us better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with it.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, The attacquing the Port of <hi>Breſt</hi> it ſelf, is a principal end and uſe of theſe Land Forces on Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board. Not to get it for our Selves, for that requires a much greater Force: but to ſpoil it to the <hi>French.</hi> which would deſtroy at once their Power at Sea, they having no other Harbour for great Ships upon all this Coaſt. Let us therefore conſider how this Port lies. It opens to the Weſtward: being at the very Lands end of <hi>France</hi> (which is much broader than that of <hi>England,</hi>) juſt where the Bay of <hi>Biſcay</hi> comes up to the Mouth of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Channel. Without this Port there is a Commodious Bay, almoſt in form of a Semicircle, and about two Leagues over: the Seamen call it <hi>Breſt-Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> The depth of it in moſt places is from ten to fifteen Fathom, and no where under ſeven. The en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of the Port is about a League in length, and about half a League broad. And cloſe under the Southern Shore of it there is a deep and narrow Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel; the reſt being rocky, and ſhoat water. As for
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:104459:8"/>the Port it ſelf, it is much greater within than the Bay is without; being deep for the moſt part, and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the main Land by divers Creeks or Spurs. and upon a Northerly Creek of it the Town of <hi>Breſt</hi> is ſituate: being exceeding ſtrong, and very well mann'd and furniſht. Here now it is plain, that there is no attempting the Town, with the Force that can now be brought againſt it. Nor indeed would it do us any Service to have it, as long as the <hi>French</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the Entrance of the Port, which we muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume they have ſtrongly fortified. We muſt therefore apply our Thoughts to this Entrance of the Port, and to the Bay without. As for the Bay, (to ſpeak of that firſt,) there is no doubt, but that if we had a great Fort on each ſide, and in them two or three hundred good reaching Guns, the <hi>French</hi> would find it very uneaſie riding or lying in this Bay, and not very ſafe paſſing. I have been preſent, where Men of great Skill have had a large Draught of this Bay before them, and have pointed to the very places where theſe Forts ſhould be. And ſurely if we are Maſters at Sea, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can hinder us from making theſe Forts. Then for the Entrance of the Harbor, there are divers things that may be done there. One thing is, (and they that well know the place do think it very feaſable,) to choke the narrow Channel or Paſſage by ſinking of Ships. which being loaden with Stone-work and Tarras, will not eaſily be removed. Another thing is, to make a good Fort on the Northern ſide of this Entrance:
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:104459:9"/>where I think the <hi>French</hi> have no Fort, the deep Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel being on the other ſide. But if they have a Fort there, and it cannot ſpeedily be taken, we muſt make another not too near it. which, though half a League from the deep Channel, would ſhrewdly annoy both ſingle Ships, and much more grand Fleets, in their paſſage. A third thing is, to make a good Fort on the Southern ſide, juſt upon the deep Channel. where, though the <hi>French</hi> may have more than one already, yet they cannot have ſo many, but that another Fort may live by them; this Shore (as hath been ſaid) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing three Miles in length. 'Tis much if we cannot find a place without their outermoſt Fort, which though it be not ſo very near the deep Channel, may yet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand it ſufficiently. But if there be no ſuch place without, we muſt fix upon one within. and our Forces being landed from the Bay, may by Land come down to it. You will ſay that ſuch a place cannot be relieved and ſupplied by Sea, the <hi>French</hi> having a Fort without it. But I anſwer, That this cannot hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſmall Veſſels from coming to it by Night, and at high Water. for even the ſhallow parts of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance will be then deep to ſuch Veſſels. There is yet another thing to be done at this Entrance into the Port of <hi>Breſt:</hi> and that is, That ſince by the deepneſs of the Channel, our great Ships may come cloſe to the Forts lying upon it, they may (with their mighty force of Cannon) beat theſe Forts about the <hi>French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens</hi> Ears. which will be the eaſier done, if they are
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:104459:9"/>attacqued by Land at the ſame time. They that are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with theſe Matters, know that a Fort in ſuch caſes is a meer idle Bugbeare: and that any Fort, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachable by great Ships, may be thus beaten to pieces. unleſs it be large, and have a mighty number of Guns. for then it may be too hard for the Ships at their own Weapon. I confeſs this thing requires great skill and courage: nor is it to be done by every Fool. but I know the Men, that can and dare do it.</p>
            <p>I muſt now anſwer ſome Objections againſt this Project of a Deſcent.</p>
            <p>It may be objected, that having propoſed twenty thouſand Men to be employed againſt <hi>France,</hi> I do af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards deſign further to have ſeveral great Garriſons: which may take up above forty thouſand Men more. ſo that I have out-run my own Propoſal. To this I anſwer, That 'tis true, here will be required an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of Men; which we may ſafely preſume we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not want, if they are well paid, and have good <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Officers. but here will be no increaſe of Charge, which is the main thing to be feared. For theſe Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons will maintain themſelves. and by how much greater they are, by ſo much better they will do it.</p>
            <p>It may alſo be objected, that the way here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, is a very laborious and chargeable way of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering. it would probably coſt us leſs to take Towns ready fortified and furniſht, than to raiſe theſe Fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from the Ground. But I anſwer, That we muſt not
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:104459:10"/>think of taking ſtrong Towns, unleſs we had an Army that would make us clearly Maſters of the Field. Such an Army, I confeſs, might find every thing eaſy. but ſuch an Army we cannot have in <hi>France,</hi> unleſs we had a Peace in <hi>Ireland.</hi> which Peace it concern'd us to have upon any Terms, that ſo we might apply all our Force to pull down this <hi>French</hi> King. for except we do it, we are in great danger to be deſtroyed by him. Since therefore, by reaſon of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> War con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing, we cannot do as we would, we muſt do as we may. Moreover the Method here propoſed, though it may ſeem flow and heavy, yet it is ſure, and void of all hazard; there being hardly a poſſibility of miſcarriage. and it would put the <hi>French,</hi> whom we muſt allow to be ſhrewd Gameſters, quite beſide their Play. And what would the Charge of theſe Fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations be? It would chiefly conſiſt in the Labour of Men; and here are twenty thouſand ready to perform it. And a ſmall matter given to thoſe that labour, over and above their ordinary Pay, would make them la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour chearfully. which was the way of the old Princes of <hi>Orange.</hi> Suppoſe then, that one time with another, there be twelve thouſand Men at Work: at a Groat a day extraordinary. this comes in the whole to two hundred pound a day: which for every hundred days is twenty thouſand pound, and ſeventy three thouſand for the whole yeare. which is no ſuch affrighting Sum.</p>
            <p>It may be objected likewiſe, that having fortified theſe Places as it hath been here projected, we ſhall lofe
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:104459:10"/>them when we have done. And the freſh Example of <hi>Valona,</hi> and of <hi>Calice</hi> of old, and afterwards of <hi>Oſtend, Candia</hi> and <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> ſeem to ſtrengthen this Apprehenſion. But all this notwithſtanding, it will be very hard and very ſtrange, if the whole Power of <hi>England</hi> ſhould not be able to defend a great and ſtrong Intrenchment, againſt any Power whatſoever. that is, If the place be near us, and lie open to Sea, of which Sea we are Maſters. for ſuch a place hath the whole Power of <hi>England</hi> to ſupport it. What do you talk of <hi>Valona?</hi> If we cannot do better than the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> we deſerve to have our Legs cut off. Theſe are they, that when their Enemy could make no reſiſtance conſiderable, being ſo terribly over-laid elſewhere; have been trifling away their time, for divers years, in making a Conqueſt that is not worth one Farthing. for it will never bear the charge of maintaining it. But had the gallant <hi>Cornaro</hi> who took <hi>Valona</hi> been alive, (the only Man of the <hi>Venetians</hi> that deſerves that Name;) he would not have loſt it in that manner, while a Fleet with Land Forces on board it lay in the Harbour. He would have put himſelf into the Town, taking both his Landmen and Seamen with him; and have made good the Breach (for it ſeems a Breach was made) by repairing, and retrenching, and ſtrength of Men. As for <hi>Calice,</hi> it was loſt by the Sottiſhneſs of Queen <hi>Maries</hi> Council; and their ſhameful neglect to ſend it Supplies, notwithſtanding the repeated In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the Lord <hi>Wentworth</hi> then Governour. <hi>Oſtend</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:104459:11"/>was too little, and was loſt for want of ground. how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it held out a violent Siege of three years and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. But <hi>Candia</hi> is an encouragement to this forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Project. for if we can raiſe Fortifications in two or three months, that can ſtand a Siege of above twenty years, as <hi>Candia</hi> did; we need not repent the Bargain. I could wiſh that <hi>Dunkirk</hi> might be paſt over in ſilence: for the ſelling of it, eſpecially to the <hi>French,</hi> is a ſhame to our Nation. I do well remember a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe, not long after the thing was done, between a Knight and an Squire upon this Subject. The Knight was the before-mention'd Sir <hi>Tobias Bridges,</hi> who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Horſe there: the Squire ſhall be nameleſs: But he deſired to know of the Knight, what were the true Reaſons of our parting with <hi>Dunkirk.</hi> and the Knight ask'd him again, what He (the Squire) thought to be the true Reaſons of it. I had rather (ſaid the Squire) learn from You, who know better. But I (ſaid the Knight) deſire to hear Your Reaſons. Then ſaid the Squire, I have heard ſeveral Reaſons alledged. One is, That the keeping it would be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Charge to us. Not ſo, ſays the Knight, for the Parliament that eſtabliſht the Kings Revenue, had the Article of <hi>Dunkirk</hi> laid before them among the other Expences of the Crown; and they allowed it, and provided fully for it. ſo that it could not be accounted a Charge to the King. but however it would be a Charge to the Kingdom, ſaid the Squire. If the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, ſaid the Knight, were willing to bear it, as they
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:104459:11"/>were moſt willing; where was the harm? And how could they beſtow Money better, then towards the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a brave Nurſery of Soldiers, in a Poſt of mighty importance and advantage both to Sea and Land, and in exact and compleat Military Diſcipline? But more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over the Charge, when the Works were finiſht, would have been inconſiderable. For we commanded ſuch a Contribution in the Countries, forty Miles every way, as would maintain the Garriſon: at leaſt within a ſmall matter. And therefore, the Knight added, what you have ſaid about the Charge, is no Reaſon. Then the Squire proceeding; Another Reaſon, ſaith he, is this: That the Place is not relievable by Sea, it lying ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from it. I confeſs, ſaid the Knight, that it lies near half a Mile from the Sea. But the Ground between the Sea and the Town is ſo low and ſo wet, that no Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my can work through it to block up the Paſſage. And therefore this is no Reaſon neither: have you any more Reaſons? Yes, ſays the Squire, I have one Reaſon more; They ſay the Place was not ſtrong, nor could it ever be made ſtrong. Here the Knight granted, that the Town was not compleatly ſtrong while We <hi>Engliſh</hi> held it. But, ſaid he, whoever had ſeen the New Works, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun and a good deal advanced by My Lord <hi>Tiviott,</hi> muſt have allowed that it might be made very ſtrong. What could you do with the Sand-hills, ſaid the Squire, which when a ſtrong Wind came that way, did uſe to blow into the Town Ditches, and to fill them quite up? We took a courſe with thoſe Hills, anſwer'd the Knight: for we carried them clear away, and threw them into
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:104459:12"/>wet Ditches and Marſhes, whence they will never riſe more. And to ſpeak at once, the Place is now in fact one of the ſtrongeſt of <hi>Europe.</hi> Then ſaid the Squire, I have given you my Reaſons, and I can think of no more at preſent: pray let me now hear Your Reaſons. I ſhall give but one Reaſon, ſaid the Knight: which I think the true one. The <hi>French</hi> had then an Army on foot, and not far from us. And if this Army had marched ſtraight to <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> and had attacqued it in the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it was in, and before the New Works were finiſht, in all probability they had carried it. It ſeemed therefore adviſable rather to ſell it for Money, then to have it taken from us by Force. But what if the Garriſon had been doubled, ſaid the Squire, till theſe New Works could have been finiſh'd? Nay that, ſaid the Knight, would have made it hot work. Why then I will undertake, ſaid the Squire, that to relieve <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> the Auxiliaries of <hi>London</hi> would have marched at two days warning. and all other parts of <hi>England</hi> accordingly. And therefore the Reaſon you have given, proves alſo no Reaſon. You muſt take it as it is, ſaid the Knight; for I can give no better. And ſo this Diſcourſe ended. Which I have inſerted here, to give ſome light into that ugly Buſineſs of <hi>Dunkirk.</hi> She that loſt <hi>Calice</hi> did uſe to ſay; that when ſhe was dead, they ſhould find <hi>Calice</hi> at her Heart. But He that ſold <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> deſerv'd to have it written upon his Forehead. it is ſurely a Brand upon his Memory. Had the Intereſt or Honour of our Nation been minded, or any thing but Baſeneſs and Vice, and the <hi>French</hi> Greatneſs; We might have kept <hi>Dunkirk</hi> to this day. And there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:104459:12"/>either in that or in the other Inſtances, that ſhould diſcourage us from embracing the Project here offer'd. But enough of this: let us now proceed in the Objections.</p>
            <p>It may be objected further, that here is a Deſign for em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying twenty Thouſand Men; and nothing hath been ſaid, where or how we ſhall have them. To this I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; that if nothing hath been ſaid hitherto, it is now time to ſay ſomething. But it hath been already intimated, that all the Forces we can ſpare from the <hi>Iriſh</hi> War, and turn againſt <hi>France,</hi> which were ſuppoſed about twenty Thouſand, might be put into our <hi>Fleet.</hi> But you will ſay, they are already in <hi>Flanders:</hi> I anſwer, they are then ſo much out of their way. but they may be eaſily taken on board, (I mean chiefly the Foot) from <hi>Oſtend</hi> and <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port.</hi> You will ſay further, that they cannot be ſpared from thoſe Parts and I anſwer further, that they may well be ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, if they draw after them twice as many <hi>French:</hi> which they will certainly do. For the <hi>French</hi> muſt defend their maritime Provinces, and Country Militias cannot do it: ſo that of neceſſity they muſt draw back great Numbers of their regular Troops, tho even theſe alſo will be too lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, if the Methods be followed that have been here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed. But were it not for the <hi>Iriſh</hi> War, we might leave our Forces in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and fill our Fleet with thoſe now in <hi>Ireland.</hi> And therefore ſome that wiſh well to <hi>England,</hi> and to their Majeſties happy Government; wiſh the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Lands we fight for, were all in the bottom of the great Ocean. in regard they take us off from our Main Buſineſs, which is the hewing down of the <hi>French</hi> King. While we
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:104459:13"/>are rooting out the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> and in purſuit of their Lands, God only knows to what Diſtreſſes we may be brought. The Loſſes we have received already, and the Difficulties and Hazards that may befall us hereafter, muſt all be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to theſe <hi>Iriſh</hi> Lands. Could we have turn'd our whole Force againſt the <hi>French,</hi> theſe things had not been: it had, in all likelihood, given a new face to the War up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Continent. But you will ſay; as the War of <hi>Ireland</hi> continues, ſo that Men cannot be had from thence for the Project here offer'd: So out of <hi>Flanders</hi> they cannot be had, becauſe we are obliged to have them there, (that is, eight or ten Thouſand of them to aſſiſt the <hi>Dutch,</hi> by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of a Treaty with King <hi>Charles.</hi> To this I anſwer, that it is much doubted, whether this Treaty do thus oblige us. It obliges both Parties to aſſiſt each other with that Number, in caſe either be attacqued. But if both be attac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qued, the Obligation ſtems to ceaſe, and we muſt take new Meaſures: both being concern'd to do their utmoſt againſt eth Common Enemy. Moreover the <hi>Dutch</hi> might be more effectually aſſiſted, by our having theſe Men in <hi>Normandy</hi> or <hi>Bretagne,</hi> then by our having them in <hi>Flanders.</hi> So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wile if the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> have twenty Thouſand Pounds a Month, it might do him more Service to have this Mony (which would maintain 10000 Men more) employed upon the Project here offer'd, than to have it remitted <hi>in ſpecie:</hi> For the good Effects of a Deſcent upon <hi>Normandy</hi> or <hi>Bretagne,</hi> would be felt in <hi>Piemont.</hi> Thus we have found Money as well as Men, towards the carrying on our Project. There is a further means to get Men, which is this. I have ſaid before, that if a good Part
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:104459:13"/>of our ſtanding Forces were drawn down to the Sea-ſide towards-<hi>France,</hi> they might there ly ready to embark, for relieving and renforcing our <hi>French</hi> Garriſons. And they may in like manner be employed in our firſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcents or Invaſions. Nor would they be taken off there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by from their Buſineſs, that is, their Guard of <hi>England.</hi> For that Sea being narrow, and our Fleet commanding it; they would in effect have one Foot in <hi>England,</hi> while the other is in <hi>France.</hi> But there is an Expedient yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining, both for Men and Money, which will be ſure to do the Work: and which we muſt make uſe of, if the reſt ſhould fail. and that is, that we now raiſe this twenty Thouſand Men, and likewiſe raiſe Money to maintain them. And this is the thing I have now to ſay in this matter, if nothing had been ſaid before.</p>
            <p>I hope I have fully ſatisfied all the Objections. But this laſt Expedient may perhaps be a little ſtartling. What? More Mony at this time of day? Yes, more Money, when all lies at Stake; and to preſerve us from utter Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. there being (I fear) no means to prevent it, but by a Deſcent upon <hi>France;</hi> which muſt be carried on with this Money. We muſt therefore reſolve, in this great Exigence, to ſtrain our ſelves to the utmoſt. We muſt do any thing, rather than be Slaves to the <hi>French.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But whereas I have ſpoken of raiſing Men and Money, theſe Matters deſerve to be further conſider'd. As for the Men, we may rely upon it, that they will come in moſt readily and cheerfully for a Deſcent upon <hi>France.</hi> Provided there be two things obſerved, which I have
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:104459:14"/>ſlightly mentioned before. The firſt thing is, that they be all <hi>Engliſh.</hi> For <hi>England</hi> had always Men enow for a <hi>French</hi> Voyage: and it would be very diſpleaſing to have Foreiners put upon us, as if our Nation were either deſpiſed or diſtruſted. <hi>England</hi> alſo will afford good Officers, if Care be taken to have the beſt: but if all the Care be to have the worſt, I confeſs they will be very ordinary. and ſo it would be with the braveſt Nation upon Earth. But all this while it is not intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the poor <hi>French</hi> Proteſtants ſhould be excluded from joyning with us. They have been driven from their Country, by the Jeſuitical bigotted Rage of their inhumane Tyrant; who hath exceeded all the Barbarities of the Heathen Perſecutors. And the reſtoring of theſe poor People, next to our own Preſervation, is the great End we aim at. So that there is no Doubt, but that we ſhould gladly receive them amongſt us, under their own Officers. The ſecond thing to be obſerved, to facilitate the raiſing of the Men, is this: that there be a good Fund for their Payment, and appropriated to it; and that their Money, to prevent all Feare of Diſappointments, be managed by ſuch hands as they like. A Committee of Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, ſome think, would be the moſt acceptable. And if his Majeſty would be graciouſly pleaſed (in this extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Occaſion) to give leave to the ſame Committee to recommend the Officers, it would be very much for his Service. Theſe are the two things, which being duly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, there will enow good Men (both Officers and Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers) come in chearfully to this Expedition. And ſo I have done with one Branch of the Expedient, which is the rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Men.</p>
            <pb n="23" facs="tcp:104459:14"/>
            <p>I now come to the other Branch, which is the raiſing of Money. And I am ſtill of opinion (for my opinion hath been made known already) that an Exciſe upon a great many Commodities of general Uſe, is without compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the beſt way of raiſing it. Two pence a pair upon Shoos, would raiſe a hundred thouſand pounds yearly. and it might be four pence or ſix pence. If this ſeem hard to the Poor, they may wear Cloggs, or Shoos with woodden Soles, which are ſuppoſed Duty-free. And this may ſave a great deal of Sole-leather: which is as good as Plate, and might be exported to the great Advantage of the Kingdom. But if they think ſcorn to wear this ſort of Shoos, they muſt pay the Duty of the other. The Duty, I confeſs, will lie a little hard upon the Shoomakers: as all Taxes lie harder upon ſome than upon others. But to make them ſome amends, and likewiſe to raiſe more Money, a high Duty might be laid upon all unwrought Leather exported. It is a great doubt, whether the Expor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Leather be convenient or not. Some think that it ought to be wholly prohibited, as it was by the old Laws; upon the ſame Reaſons with that of Wooll. and ſome think it ſhould be freely permitted, as by our new Laws it is. But the middle way is certainly the beſt; that is, to permit it under a high Duty. And ſurely if all our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitions were turn'd into Duties, it would be a happy thing. I name no other Commodities, fit for an Exciſe. though there be many ſuch, that are obious to any Mans Thoughts. and a few of them would raiſe a greater Sum, than is required for this Service.</p>
            <p>But if nothing elſe will do the Buſineſs, a Land Tax
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:104459:15"/>will. And we need not queſtion, but that, to carry on a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent into <hi>France,</hi> the Parliament will chearfully grant it, and the People will chearfully pay it. Such a Tax as we pay this year, being granted forthwith for the year following, will give a preſent Credit for more than is needful for this Affair. And to bring the Tax to ſome Equality, and to eaſe a great many People; No Man to pay above two Shillings in the pound. The Abatements to be allowed by Commiſſioners in the Counties, upon good Proofs made before them; and to be confirm'd by a Committee of Lord and Commons, the Proofs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them tranſmitted in writing. By which means the whole Amount of the Tax will be about a Million. The Pay of the twenty thouſand Men for a whole year, reckoning alſo two thouſand of them to be Horſe, will take up little more then half this Money: and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidue will defray all other Charges and ſpare.</p>
            <p>Thus I have laid open my whole Project. Which if it be purſued, I make no doubt but it will bring great Advantages to <hi>England,</hi> or at leaſt great Terror and Confuſion to the <hi>French.</hi> For tho we ſhould fail in our main Deſign, though we ſhould not be able to ſeize any Ports, or having done it ſhould not be able to defend them; yet the very attempting theſe things in ſeveral places, (in one place to day, and a hundred Miles off the day following,) would haraſs our Enemies to that degree, that they would never be able to ſtand under it. We may remember, that in the beginning of the late Confederate War, the <hi>Dutch</hi> ſent out a great Fleet, with ſome thouſands of Landmen on board it, under <hi>De Ruyter</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:104459:15"/>and <hi>Van Trompe.</hi> Theſe paſt through the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel together: but with ſuch haſte, as if they had been running the Gantlope. They never ſo much as once ſtood over to the <hi>French</hi> Coaſt, or hardly look'd upon it, thereby to amuſe and alarm the Enemy. When they were come to the Channels Mouth, the Fleet divided. <hi>De Ruiter</hi> with the greateſt part ſailed away to the <hi>Weſt Indies,</hi> where he did nothing: <hi>Trompe</hi> with the reſt falling down to the River of <hi>Nantes.</hi> near which he ſeized a ſmall Iſland, ſeparated by a narrow Channel from the Main. And here he lay quiet and ſtill for about two Months: not offering to do any thing at Land; nor moving with his Fleet, as he might and ſhould have done, ſometimes towards <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> and <hi>Bayonne,</hi> and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times towards the South Coaſt of <hi>Bretagne.</hi> As if he made it his buſineſs to give the <hi>French</hi> as little diſturbance as he could. But however, diſturbed they were at a ſtrange rate. All that part of <hi>France</hi> was in Arms, under four or five Country Dukes, with as much diſtraction as can be imagined. And by the continual Marching to and fro of ſo many thouſands (for they were in mighty Numbers,) Proviſions for Horſe and Man upon all that Sea Coaſt were almoſt wholly conſumed and devoured. In which condition they were like to continue all Summer; when on the ſudden, (and for ſome cunning Reaſons I am yet to learn,) <hi>Trompe</hi> takes his Men on board, and ſets ſail for <hi>Cales.</hi> and from thence round to <hi>Catalonia.</hi> where he land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Men again, who were now reduced to twelve hundred, to joyn the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Army. And the <hi>Spaniards</hi> wonder'd, when they beheld ſuch a contemptible Party,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:104459:16"/>that thoſe ſhould be the Men that had made ſo great a Noiſe in the World, and had ſo alarm'd and turmoyl'd the Kingdom of <hi>France.</hi> But by this we may ſee, what might reaſonably be expected, from a vigorous and powerful Deſcent. Moreover we may know by our ſelves, how theſe things would work with <hi>France.</hi> What a condition had <hi>England</hi> been in laſt year, if <hi>Tourville</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Maſter at Sea) had had Land Forces on board him, and had uſed them to his moſt advantage; while ſo many Ports, and ſo many Countries on that Coaſt lay open to him? And if he had maſter'd and fortified any of our Ports, what Thorns had they been in our ſides? Alſo we may remember, how eaſily he landed at <hi>Torbay.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having ſeen what Good may come, by purſuing this Project of a Deſcent upon <hi>France;</hi> let us now conſider what Evils may come, in caſe it be not purſued. And truly unleſs ſomething of this nature be done, there is reaſon to fear we ſhall be hard put to it. The poſture of of our Affairs will not be very good at Sea, and will be very bad at Land. At Sea we ſhall in likelyhood be Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters for the preſent: but if we have no Land Forces on board, we ſhall make no Uſe conſiderable of that great Advantage. For the <hi>French</hi> will not come out; and We ſhall ly ſtill and do nothing, at leaſt not to any great purpoſe. 'Tis true, we may land our Seamen upon the Coaſt; and make ſome little havock, by burning or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe. but what will this ſignify? And when our Ships are foul, and our Men ſickly; the <hi>French</hi> may have Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities to revenge our foul War, in greater meaſure. Our Shores being bolder, and our Countries lying more
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:104459:16"/>open, and the things expoſed being more valuable. But at Land there ſeems to be leſs ground of Hope: at leaſt there appear extreme difficulties and dangers. In the late War of the Confederates againſt theſe <hi>French,</hi> we know with what vigour they preſt upon them, year after year, and could never do any good. And the Frontier of <hi>Flanders</hi> is ſo fortified, and that of <hi>Germany</hi> ſo waſted; the <hi>French</hi> alſo have now ſo great a Force in the Field, and they manage their Affairs with ſo much Skill and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct; that it will be very hard to make any great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion upon them, admitting our Forces to be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſuperiour. And as for <hi>Piemont,</hi> it will be happy if we can keep what is left. But why may not the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates, notwithſtanding all theſe things, march ſtraight into <hi>France:</hi> which they have been ſo highly blamed, for not doing two years ago? I anſwer, Becauſe our Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances are much alter'd ſince that time. Our March<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Forces were then treble to the <hi>French:</hi> whereas now they are little more (if any more) than equal. So that what had then been ſafe and eaſy, and almoſt impoſſible to miſcarry; may now prove a deſperate Undertaking.</p>
            <p>Since therefore the Confederates then would not, and now cannot, find the way into <hi>France</hi> by Land, We muſt do it by Sea. For into <hi>France</hi> we muſt get: or elſe this War will never have a good End; which is, the pulling down the <hi>French</hi> King. If <hi>France</hi> ſtill continue entire and untoucht; at the beſt we can hope for, he will hold us play, till he hath wearied us quite out. as it happen'd in the former War of the Confederates.</p>
            <p>It is not probable that we ſhould ever enter <hi>France</hi> by the way of <hi>Flanders,</hi> except our Kings Preſence alter the Method of that War. For the uſual Method is this. The <hi>French,</hi> if they are like to be hard match'd, make a ſhift however to encamp (little or much)
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:104459:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>within the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Quarters: and then the Confederates encamp by them, to obſerve them. as if they were chained to the <hi>French,</hi> or were drawn to them by ſome Magnetick Force. Whereas it is the Part of a skilful General, <hi>Trahere Hoſtem, non trahi:</hi> not to dance after the Enemy, but to make the Enemy dance after Him. Which was ſaid by that great Soldier, King <hi>Heury</hi> IV. (our Kings great Grandfather), in an Advice he ſent to the <hi>States of Holland;</hi> as we find it ſet down by <hi>Grotius,</hi> in his moſt excellent Hiſtory of the <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick</hi> Wars.</p>
            <p>[The doing the contrary laſt year, ſeems a Miſtake in the high-born Duke of <hi>Bazaria:</hi> who ſpent too much time in following the <hi>Dauphin,</hi> thereby putting his own Army to miſerable Hardſhips. Since he could not conveniently go round by <hi>Mentz,</hi> he might have paſſed the <hi>Rhine</hi> at <hi>Manheim;</hi> which would have drawn back the <hi>Dauphin</hi> moſt effectually. And though the Duke could have gone no further, yet <hi>Manheim</hi> had been worth his Pains and Care. For had it been well fortified on both ſides the River, it would have been as good as <hi>Mentz.</hi> It would have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded far and wide into the <hi>French</hi> Quarters, and given maintenance to ſeveral Thouſands of Men: which ſhould be a principal Aim of the <hi>Germans,</hi> ſince they abound with Men, but not with Means to maintain them. But the fortifying of Places is not to be done without Labour: which the <hi>Germans</hi> will not undergo. though that be the true way to work the <hi>French</hi> out of their Conqueſts.]</p>
            <p>But to leave this Digreſſion; ſome think that our King, with his <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> Army, might march into <hi>France</hi> by the way of <hi>Calice,</hi> and ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the Sea-Goaſt of <hi>Picardie</hi> and <hi>Normandie,</hi> having the Sea open to ſupply him. And ſo he might do, if his Army were clearly Maſter of the Field, ſo that the Enemy durſt not abide within diſtance But for him to engage ſo deep in <hi>France,</hi> and be cloſely waited on by a <hi>French</hi> Army neer as good as his own; would be a thing extremely dangerous. and the having the Sea open would not cure the matter, nor prevent many Diſcommodities and Diſtreſſes that might befall him even to his ruine. Such an Invaſion therefore is by no means adviſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, in the high Condition the <hi>French</hi> are now in. But when by our Deſcents (in which there will be no ſuch Hazards) they are diſtracted, and confounded, and every where weakened; the Confederate Armies may then from all Parts ſafely bear in upon <hi>France,</hi> and in all Probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity come to a good Market. And then may the poor <hi>French</hi> Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, together with that whole Nation, expect deliverance from the horrid Oppreſſions they ly under: and the reſt of <hi>Europe</hi> be freed from their Apprehenſions of Slavery and Deſtruction.</p>
